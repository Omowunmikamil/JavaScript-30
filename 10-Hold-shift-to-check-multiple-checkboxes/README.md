# Check Multiple Checkboxes Holding the Shift key
This simple web page demonstrates how to implement a feature where holding the Shift key while clicking checkboxes selects multiple checkboxes in between the last checked one and the current one clicked.

## Features:

- Built with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript.

## How to Use:
1. Open the web page in a browser.
2. Click on checkboxes to select them individually.
3. Hold down the Shift key and click on another checkbox to select all checkboxes in between.
