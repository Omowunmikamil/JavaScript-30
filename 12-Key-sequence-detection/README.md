# Key Sequence Detection

This simple web application demonstrates key sequence detection using JavaScript. When the user types a specific sequence of keys, it triggers a special action.

## How it Works
- **HTML Structure:** The HTML file contains a basic structure with a <script> tag to include the JavaScript code.
- **JavaScript Logic:** The JavaScript code listens for keyup events on the window. When a key is pressed, it adds the key to an array and checks if the array contains a specific secret code.
- **Triggering Action:** If the secret code is detected in the key sequence, a special function is called. In this example, it's cornify_add() from the Cornify library, which adds unicorns and rainbows to the page.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Type the secret code "omowunmi" on your keyboard.
3. Once the entire code is entered, a magical surprise will appear on the screen!
