# Array Cardio 1
This project explores various array methods in JavaScript, including filter(), map(), sort(), and reduce(), to manipulate data and perform common tasks.

## Array Data
Two arrays are provided for experimentation:

## inventors Array
An array of objects representing famous inventors, each with properties for first name, last name, birth year, and year of passing.

## people Array
An array of strings representing people's names in the format "last name, first name".

## Array Methods
1. __Filter by Birth Year__
Use the filter() method to retrieve inventors born in the 1500s.

2. __Map Full Names__
Use the map() method to create an array of full names by combining the first and last names of inventors.

3. __Sort by Birth Year__
Use the sort() method to sort the inventors array by birth year, from oldest to youngest.

4. __Calculate Total Years Lived__
Use the reduce() method to calculate the total years lived by all inventors.

5. __Sort by Years Lived__
Use the sort() method to sort the inventors array by years lived, from longest to shortest.

6. __Filter Boulevard Names__
Experiment with filtering boulevard names containing 'de' from a website (manual task).

7. __Sort People by Last Name__
Use the sort() method to sort the people array by last name.

8. __Count Transportation Instances__
Use the reduce() method to count the instances of each mode of transportation in the data array.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
Explore the console output to see the results of the array methods.
Enjoy experimenting with array methods and data manipulation in JavaScript! ðŸš€
